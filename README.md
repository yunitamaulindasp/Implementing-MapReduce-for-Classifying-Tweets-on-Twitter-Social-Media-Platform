# Implementing-MapReduce-for-Classifying-Tweets-on-Twitter-Social-Media-Platform
The rapid development of internet technology, makes the number of internet users continue to increase every year.
The number of internet users and the activities carried out by internet users have resulted in more and more data being accommodated on the internet. 
This stored data has a lot of information that can be extracted for further use in various industries, the use of the MapReduce Algorithm can help optimize large-scale data processing in a distributed manner.
The result is that the use of the MapReduce algorithm can help optimize data processing as much as 15443 in classifying data using sentiment analysis techniques.
